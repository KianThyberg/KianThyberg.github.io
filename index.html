        <h1>Kian Thyberg JS Portfolio</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Good evening. My name is Kian Thyberg, and I'm a
            Computer Science Student studying at Weber State University.
            My primary focus is in Game Development and interactive
            experiences, and this website will display my various Javascript
            exploits and demonstrations. </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Apart from computer science,
            I'm in love with art, writing, music, and mathematics, and
            overall enjoy creating things. I also collect mechanical
            pencils. My white whale is a particular yellow pencil with a
            glittery grip that has fantastic ergonomics and sadly is not
            manufactured anymore. If you ever find one, you know who to call.
            I'm a big fan of the Beatles extended discography, as well as
            all other types of music.</p>

        <h2>Javascript Projects</h2>
        <p>
            This portion of the website still under construction. Come back
            another time to see what's arisen. Peace and Love! &hearts;
        </p>
